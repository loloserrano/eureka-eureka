This project is a postmodern feminist analysis of gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Princeâ€™s *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials.* 
I use Mary Joe Frug's methodology in "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook" with a heavy postmodern queer twist to to explore how the casebook represents gendered individuals and general notions of gender. 

Below is a table of contents that lays out the roadmap for this project. 

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

### Queering Frug's Feminism

In this section I describe the purpose, framework, and theory of this project. I detail the work of Mary Joe Frug on which this project is based and introduce new ideas, both from her other pieces and from later work, that complicate the idea of gender. 

### The Cases

In this section I describe my data collecting process, the scope of the cases, and some basic preliminary information breaking down the dataset. 

### The Characters: Husbands, Wives, Bosses, Workers 

In this section I explore the individual humans who appear in the casebook as characters, understood, framed, and described by judges and casebook editors. Most of my focus in the section is on women, who appear as a minority of characters and in a strictly limited set of roles. Most strikingly, over half of the women appear in the litigation with a heterosexual partner; nearly another quarter of the women appear with another family member. 

### Implied Masculinity of Corporate Personhood?

In this section I explore general notions of masculinity and femininity as they appear in the casebook. The most striking pattern here is the significant number of businesses with masculine sounding names.
