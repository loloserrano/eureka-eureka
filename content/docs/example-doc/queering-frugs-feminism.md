Knapp, Crystal, and Prince's *Problems in Contract Law* is an American contracts casebook that attempts, in good faith and with a commercial incentive, to relay the current state and relevant history of American contract law to first-year law students. This project analyzes the individuals, organizations, and narratives within the casebook through the lens of gender: how do judges and casebook editors conceptualize, describe, and affect gendered individuals and general notions of gender? 

This is a descriptive project, but is necessarily political and comes with a heavy normative undertone. It compares the ways in which women, as a political population, appear in the casebook differently from men. Most American women could not  participate in the government or the formal economy from the countryâ€™s inception to the early twentieth century. Women did not start to occupy public positions of capitalist power in great numbers until the middle of the twentieth century. While it is slowly approaching parity (according mostly to economic metrics), there is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women and men in the public sphere.  

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contract law for most of American history. It also presents a good number of women with interesting and diverse stories. However, the women in the casebook operate within a much more limited field of action, often appearing with spouses or other family members and seldom acting as independent economic actors like most men in the book. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law. 

## Re-Reading Contracts

Mary Joe Frug was an American postmodern feminist legal scholar who produced luminary works of gender and legal theory. This project is inspired directly by Frug's ["Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook."](https://rohangrey.net/files/courses/contracts/fall2021/Frug1985.pdf). In Re-Reading Contracts, Frug conducts a holistic review of gender in Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson's *Cases and Comment on Contracts,* 4th ed. 1982.

My review of *Problems in Contract Law* replicates and updates Frug's essay. I use data visualization (charts, tables, and some interactive graphs!) to allow readers to more thoroughly grasp and explore the totality of the disparities in the book. However, I also conduct more Fruggish qualitive analysis of particularly interesting phenomena. While most of my analysis uses the categories women and men, I use the more postmodern take that Frug developed toward the end of her career and base it all on a more queer theory that gender as a physical, behavioral, and legal phenomenon is falsely binary and socially constructed. *Perhaps most importantly, this is a website, not a peer-reviewed journal, so get out your grains of salt.*
