Problems in Contract Law is an American contracts casebook that attempts, in good faith and with a commercial incentive, to relay the current state and relevant history of American contract law to first-year law students. This project analyzes the individuals, organizations, and narratives within the casebook through the lens of gender: how do judges and casebook editors conceptualize, describe, and affect gendered individuals and general notions of gender? 

This is a descriptive project, but is necessarily political, and comes with a heavy normative undertone. This project compares the ways in which women, as a political population, appear in the casebook differently from men. Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public   (again, as a political population) and men (the same), that is slowly edging towards parity according mostly to economic metrics. 

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. This is not a total denunciation of the casebook editors’ choices. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.
