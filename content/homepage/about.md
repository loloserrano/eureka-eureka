## Introduction

This project is a postmodern feminist analysis of gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Princeâ€™s *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials.* 
It uses Mary Joe Frug's methodology in "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook" with a heavy postmodern queer twist to to explore how the casebook represents gendered individuals and general notions of gender. 

See Table of Contents for an overview the project.
